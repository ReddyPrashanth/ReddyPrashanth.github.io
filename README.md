### AFGHAN

USGS participated in collaborative projects in Afghanistan’s natural resource sector from the 1950s through the early 1970s. Beginning in the late 1970s, conflict and instability in the country put an end to the USGS involvement for more than a quarter century. During that time, Afghan natural resource agencies and institutions were decimated. Scientists, technicians, and other employees were unable to continue their work or stay current in their research fields. Facilities and laboratories became largely non-functional. Instruments and equipment, as well as vehicles and logistical support, all but disappeared. However, many Afghan scientists were able to preserve decades worth of vital and irreplaceable geographic information and other data, in some cases safeguarding it in their own homes. This is a WordPress Website which has responsive map viewers for Afghan minerals, water resources and their respective data downloads.

**Technology Stack**

PHP, WordPress, JavaScript, Open Layers, GeoServer
